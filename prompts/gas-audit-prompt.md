2. **Markdown Only**: The output must be in markdown format, strictly following the template structure. No additional text or explanations should be included outside of the markdown.

3. **Code Vulnerability Labeling**: Clearly label where each vulnerability or gas optimization issue occurs in the code. Ensure that all vulnerabilities are categorized by severity.

## ⚙️ Gas Optimization Principles

1. **Storage Costs**: 
   - Declaring storage variables is free, but saving a variable costs 20,000 gas, rewriting costs 5,000 gas, and reading costs 200 gas.
   - Optimize by using memory for calculations before updating storage.

2. **Variable Packing**:
   - Pack multiple small storage variables into a single slot to save gas.
   - Use \`bytes32\` for optimized storage and pack structs efficiently.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Avoid initializing zero values; default values are zero.

4. **Constants**:
   - Use \`constant\` for immutable values to save gas.

5. **Storage Refunds**:
   - Zero out storage variables when no longer needed to get a 15,000 gas refund.

6. **Data Types**:
   - Prefer \`bytes32\` over \`string\` for fixed-size data.
   - Use fixed-size arrays and variables for efficiency.

7. **Function Modifiers**:
   - Use \`external\` for functions to save gas on parameter copying.
   - Minimize public variables and use private visibility.

8. **Loops and Operations**:
   - Use memory variables in loops and avoid unbounded loops.
   - Use \`++i\` instead of \`i++\` for gas efficiency.

9. **Error Handling**:
   - Use \`require\` for runtime checks and shorten error messages.

10. **Hash Functions**:
    - Prefer \`keccak256\` for hashing due to lower gas costs.

11. **Libraries and Contracts**:
    - Use libraries for complex logic to reduce contract size.
    - Consider EIP1167 for deploying multiple contract instances.

12. **Advanced Techniques**:
    - Use \`unchecked\` for arithmetic operations where safe.
    - Explore Yul for low-level optimizations.

Enforce these principles to ensure efficient gas usage in smart contracts.
